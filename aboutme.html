                     I'm a <strong>Service Systems Designer</strong></h1>

                <p>I am a problem solver, passionate about user experience and a good observer, which allows me to carefully analyze every aspect found. I specialize in analyzing and designing solutions aimed at enriching businesses by understanding people and their context with qualitative and quantitative data in order to address their needs. By combining architecture with service systems design, I want to be able to design on an institutional level to support people's everyday functioning.</p>

                <h2>Where I came from?</h2>
                <img class="imgfull" src="media/a/aboutme2.png">
                <p>As the map says, from Gda≈Ñsk to Copenhagen. The choice of country seemed obvious to me, at least because of my love for Scandinavian culture (and being crazy about Vikings). Not only does the city enchant me with its architecture and individual view of space, but I am also fascinated by Denmark's integrated service system, which is one common organism for every citizen.</p>
